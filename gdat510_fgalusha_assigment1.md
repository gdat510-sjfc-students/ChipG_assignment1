### Introduction

If you've ever attended a party or know my wife, you know I really like non-linear smooth functions (splines) and time series regression modelsdecomposition. For this exercise, I'll be using univariate time series data. This document is broken up into three parts:
- Data: a brief describtion of the data
- Vissualization: the data set in visual form
- Applications: possible application for the data

### Data

``` r
# Make plots and save. Will be called later as they are discussed
wine_auto_plot <- autoplot(wineind)

save_plot(device = "png",
  save.path = paste0(getwd(),"/figures"),
  file.name = "asgn1_wine_series.png",
  overwrite = FALSE,
  figure = wine_auto_plot)
```

    ## [1] "File already exists."

``` r
save_plot(device = "png",
  save.path = paste0(getwd(),"/figures"),
  file.name = "asgn1_wine_series_acf.png",
  overwrite = TRUE,
  figure = ggAcf(wineind))
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

``` r
save_plot(device = "png",
  save.path = paste0(getwd(),"/figures"),
  file.name = "asgn1_wine_series_pacf.png",
  overwrite = FALSE,
  figure = ggPacf(wineind))
```

    ## [1] "File already exists."

The *wineind* dataset from the *forecast* tracks "Australian total wine sales by wine makers in bottles &lt;= 1 litre. Jan 1980 â€“ Aug 1994."

Visualize The Data
------------------

The series exibits a seasonal patten as well as long term trend. To decompose the series, we use the autoplot function from the forecast package.

Our inital hypothesis that series possesses a seasonal trend is confirmed by the ACF(auto correlation function) which shows spikes as the la 12 & 24 values. Interestinly the lag 6 values also are significantly correlated.

We can use the PACF (partial auto correlation function) to determine the extent to which the correlations propogate.

Possible Applications
---------------------

Not surprisingly, we could use time series regression to forecast future winesales. The mulitple seasonality might require more advanced methods. Fun!
